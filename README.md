PyTerminal is a CLI Interface that is based on the terminal of your Pc or your Mac

It has 2 Modes:

### The Basic Mode 
It limits the function to the absolute basic 

### The Advanced Mode 
It offers a bit more features than the basic 


## How it Works:
Essentially, it's just an input that then calls a function that processes the input and delivers an 
output based on the mode you are in and the parameters that have been set
