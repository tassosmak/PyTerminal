# PyTerminal Legacy

PyTerminal is a somewhat terminal interface that still bases on the terminal of your computer(Unix/Windows)

It has 2 Modes:

### The Basic Mode 
it limits the function to the absoloute basic 

### The Advanced Mode 
that offers a bit more features than the basic 

i have also a added a 9 mode but it doesn't serve any purpose it's just for testing purposes :)

## How it Works:
essentially its just an input that then calls a function that procces the input and deliever an 
output based on the mode you are and the parameters that have been set
